# Technical Specifications

## Introduction

This document outlines the technical architecture and specifications for the Marketing App platform. The system is designed as a comprehensive solution for marketing teams to manage content, run email campaigns, and collaborate on advertising materials.

The architecture follows a microservices approach with a focus on scalability, security, and maintainability. Key technical decisions include:

- **Database Strategy**: Hybrid approach using PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB for content
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with standardized error handling and authentication
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access controls
- **Media Handling**: S3/CloudFront architecture with CDN integration
- **Background Processing**: Robust job scheduling for email campaigns and analytics

The implementation supports multiple deployment environments (development, staging, production) with infrastructure-as-code principles and CI/CD integration.

## System Architecture Overview

The Marketing App consists of several interconnected services:

1. **User/Team Management Service**: Handles authentication, authorization, and team collaboration
2. **Media Management Service**: Manages upload, storage, and retrieval of media assets
3. **Ad Creation Service**: Provides tooling for creating and managing advertisements
4. **Email Campaign Service**: Manages subscriber lists and campaign execution
5. **Analytics Service**: Tracks engagement metrics and provides reporting capabilities

Each service is independently deployable and scalable, communicating through well-defined APIs.
